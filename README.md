I love building fantastic user experiences powered by data. It's a fun challenge to bring together the product thinking, math, software engineering, and design required to make a product feel like it has empathy. I'm particularly interested in search, discovery, recommendations, personalization.

I use github to share side projects I work on for fun. If you want to connect email me at jkatzur@gmail.com
